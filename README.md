## This is the development branch for the backend

**The backend is (tentatively) complete**

When working on the project:
- Create a new local branch on your machine that tracks your local dev branch
- After finishing work, commit only files that were changed
- Merge your branch back into your local dev
- Push commits from local/dev to remote/dev
